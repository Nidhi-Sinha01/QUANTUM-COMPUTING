## Introduction

Quantum computing is an emerging field of study that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to develop powerful computing systems. Unlike classical computers, which use bits to represent information as either 0s or 1s, quantum computers utilize quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously, thanks to quantum superposition and entanglement. This unique property of qubits allows quantum computers to perform complex computations exponentially faster than classical computers for certain problems.

## Contents

This repository contains a variety of resources and materials related to quantum computing, including:

- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step tutorials and guides on quantum computing concepts, algorithms, and programming languages such as Qiskit and Cirq.
- **Code Examples**: Sample code implementations demonstrating quantum algorithms, circuit designs, and simulations.
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks with interactive examples and explanations of quantum computing principles and applications.
- **References**: Curated list of books, research papers, online courses, and other external resources for further exploration and learning.
